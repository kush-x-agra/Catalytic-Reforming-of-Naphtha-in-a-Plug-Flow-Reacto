# Catalytic-Reforming-of-Naphtha-in-a-Plug-Flow-Reacto
Modeling and Simulation of Catalytic Reforming of Naphtha in a Plug Flow Reactor Using MATLAB
– Objective: To model and simulate the catalytic reforming of naphtha in a packed-bed plug flow reactor for performance prediction and process optimization.
– Approach: Developed a kinetic and thermal reactor model in MATLAB incorporating four key reactions (isomerization, dehydrocyclization, dehydrogenation, cracking), heat effects, and catalyst deactivation. Solved seven coupled ODEs using ode45 to track concentration profiles, temperature changes, and catalyst activity along reactor length.
– Result: Achieved 85% paraffin conversion and 60% aromatics yield, capturing endothermic behavior and catalyst decay trends. Demonstrated proficiency in reaction engineering, numerical simulation, and MATLAB-based chemical process modeling.
